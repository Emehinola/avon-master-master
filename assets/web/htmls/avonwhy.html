        <h4>Why you should get an Avon Plan; See how it works </h4>
        <p>In life, there are always surprises (both pleasant and unpleasant) so it’s important to always have a plan. When it comes to your health, here are three reasons for you to get a plan: </p>
        <h4>1. Your finances are protected</h4>
        <p>Medical emergencies, especially acute illnesses and surgeries are very expensive and can run into hundred of thousands of naira. With a health plan, this financial burden does not fall on you, the HMO steps in. This allows you to get treated without having to shell out cash because you’ve already planned for it. </p>
        <h4>2. Access to quality care whenever and wherever you need it </h4>
        <p>Without a healthcare plan, a bout of fever will have you self-medicating to save cost when going to a hospital for proper tests and diagnosis is the proper thing to do. What if there’s a complication from improper treatment due to self-medication?  </p>
        <p>With a health plan you have access to quality care whenever you need it without worrying about cost. </p>
        <h4>3. Preventive care and early intervention </h4>
        <p>Regular medical checks are non-existent without a health plan but they are how most serious illnesses get spotted early. It’s easier to deal with a problem if it is noticed on time and a healthcare plan affords one the opportunity to do this</p>
