    <p>Avon HMO may refund medical expenses (for covered services) in the event of an EMERGENCY LIFE  
    THREATENING SITUATION ONLY, where you had to be rushed to a hospital that is not on the Avon
    HMO network and therefore had to pay for emergency care. Please do not apply if it is not an 
    emergency as a refund will not be made. For emergency situations, the HMO should be informed
    immediately, or within 24/48 hours at the latest. If the enrollee is unconscious, a third party 
    (enrolleeâ€™s HR, colleague or relative) should inform the HMO within 24-48 hours. You can always 
    reach out to our contact centre, available 24/7 to assist you.</p>

    <p>In non-emergency situations, kindly contact Avon HMO should you require assistance at any time.
    Please, always contact the HMO to notify us of your intent to make payment out of pocket for any
    reasons. Do not make any payment without pre-notification to the HMO.</p>

    <p>To enable us process your refund, we would need:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Comprehensive medical report(s) showing all drugs given; tests / procedures carried out;
            admission dates and diagnosis.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Detailed receipt(s) of payment or itemized hospital invoice clearly showing the cost and
              breakdown of the services rendered. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Refund code (which will be provided by our call centre once the HMO is pre-notified of your
            intent to make payment out of pocket. Always ensure you apply for a refund 
            with the refund code given).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The required documents must be sent to Avon HMO no later than 30 days from encounter date.
     Kindly note that refund would be denied if all the above requirement(s) are not met.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please note that all refunds are subject to investigation and review. In all instances, the<br>
 refund being claimed must be in respect of medical services that are covered by the health plan. Any
 refund requests for services accessed outside the HMO network providers, will be processed based
 on the amount we would have paid your primary provider or any provider within your plan access.</p>
