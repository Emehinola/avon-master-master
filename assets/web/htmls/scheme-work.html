        <h4>How the Avon HMO Scheme Works</h4>
        <p>Welcome,</p>

        <p>If you are reading this, then you must have signed up for an Avon HMO health plan and would like to know how it works.
        By the time you finish reading, you’ll have all the information you need.

        <h4>1.	Accessing Care At The Hospital</h4>
        <p>If you need medical care and you have an Avon HMO health plan, all you need to do is to visit your primary care
        provider, this is the hospital you select from our network when signing up. Usually, your primary care provider
        should be one close to your neighbourhood. When you get there, just present your Avon HMO ID card and we’ll handle
        the rest</p>

        <p>If you do not have your ID card or number with you, the hospital will call us to verify your identity.
        Should they decline to attend to you, please do not leave without a resolution, simply contact our Call Centre
        on 07002779800 for immediate assistance. </p>

        <p>If you have a medical emergency, you may not be able to go to your primary care provider depending on your
        location. In this case, please go to the nearest hospital in our network.</p>

        <p>In emergency cases, it’s important to inform us immediately or within 24 to 48 hours. This is important because it
        enables us to ensure you’re well cared for, or also process any refund that may be payable to you. </p>

        <h4>2.	Accessing care when out of town</h4>

        <p> You may also need medical care when you’re out of your state of residence. We call these ‘out of station’ cases.
        If this happens, kindly contact our call centre for recommendations on the nearest Avon HMO provider you can go to.
        We would authorize the hospital to attend to you, so you won’t have to pay for treatments you’re entitled to.</p>

        <p>Remember, you can always reach our call Centre via:</p>

        <p>Telephone: <b>07002779800</b> </p>
        <p>Email: <b>callcentre@avonhealthcare.com</b></p>
        <p>WhatsApp: <b>08175133802</b></p>
        <p>SMS: <b>08175133802</b></p>

        <h4>3.	How To Access Dental And Optical Services</h4>

        <p>Should you need dental or optical care, please call our call centre for a recommendation and to also check if
        you’re eligible for that service. Either way, the dental or optical centre will need to contact Avon HMO for
        pre-authorization. This only takes a few minutes.</p>

        <h4>4.	Getting Pre-Authorization</h4>

        <p>This is basically a go-ahead, given by your health insurer that a health care service, treatment plan, prescription
        drug, etc. Is medically necessary. Providers may need to obtain pre-authorization for services like optical care,
        dental care, maternity services, drugs for chronic ailments, specialist consultations, out-of-station cases etc.</p>

        <P>Should you be kept waiting at the hospital for an extended period without any explanation, please call our call
        centrevia:</P>

        <P>Telephone: <b>07002779800</b></P>
        <P>Email: <b>callcentre@avonhealthcare.com</b></P>
        <P>Whatsapp: <b>08175133802</b></P>
        <P>SMS: <b>08175133802</b></p>

        <H4>5.	How to Get Refunds</H4>

        <P>Well, in the event of an emergency where you had to be rushed to a hospital that is not on the Avon HMO network
        and therefore had to pay for out of pocket, we may refund your medical expenses. However, this only applies to the
        services covered on your health plan.</P>

        <P>For your refund to be processed, you would need to:</P>


        <ol>
        <li>Obtain a comprehensive medical report and detailed receipt of payment.</li>
        <li>Reach out to our contact centre and complete the refund from that would be sent to you.</li>
        <li>Send all required documents no later than 30 days from the encounter date.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Once all requirements have been fulfilled, your refund will be processed within 20 working days.</p>

        <p>That’s all you need to know about how your Avon HMO plan works and we hope you enjoy a healthier fuller life with us.
